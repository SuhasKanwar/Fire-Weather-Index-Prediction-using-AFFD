# Algerian Forest Fires Prediction Model

This project aims to predict the Fire Weather Index (FWI) to help manage and prevent forest fires in Algeria. The model leverages machine learning techniques to provide insights into fire risk levels based on meteorological and environmental data.

## Project Overview
Forest fires are a significant environmental concern. By predicting the Fire Weather Index (FWI), this project aims to:
- Identify high-risk areas for forest fires.
- Provide actionable insights for disaster management teams.
- Reduce the environmental and economic impact of forest fires.

## Features
- **FWI Prediction**: Predicts the Fire Weather Index using meteorological data.
- **Data Visualization**: Gain insights through graphs and plots.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assesses the performance of various machine learning models.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Scikit-learn
  - Flask
- **Tools**:
  - Jupyter Notebook
  - AWS Elastic Beanstalk for deployment
